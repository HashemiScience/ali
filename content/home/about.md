# Biography
I am an Assistant Professor (CLA) at McMaster University, teaching various courses in the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour. Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences.

I spend most of my time teaching undergraduates about topics in psychology such as Sensory Processes, Attitudes & Persuasion, Statistics & Research Methods, and History of Psychology. If I'm not teaching undergrads, I'm teaching my pandemic-born baby boy how to be!

Although most of my time is spent teaching, I am a trained experimental psychologist with broad interests in the field of vision sciences and learning. I'm specifically interested in understanding how the visual system learns a specific task, and then under what conditions does that learning generalize to other tasks or contexts.

Though my role is teaching-focused, the shift to doing online studies due to the pandemic has opened up many opportunities to engage in research related not just to vision sciences, but also to pedagogical practices in the virtual learning environment. I'm also a firm believer in teaching with compassion, and am always looking for ways to create a more inclusive space for students and colleagues!
