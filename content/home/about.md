# Biography
I am an Assistant Professor (CLA) at McMaster University, teaching various courses in the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour. Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences.

I spend most of my time teaching undergraduates about statistics and research methods, as well as a variety of other courses focused on sensation & perception, attitudes & attitude change, and the history of psychology. I am a firm believer of teaching with both passion and compassion, and am always looking for ways to improve the inclusivity and accessibility of my teaching. If you're a current student trying to learn more about me and have some tips on how I can improve your learning experience, shoot me an email or visit one of my office hours! I'm always listening.

Although most of my time is spent teaching, I am a trained experimental psychologist with broad interests in the field of vision sciences and learning. I'm specifically interested in uncovering situations where the visual system learns to complete a given task but is then challenged to transfer the learned skill to novel tasks. As it turns out, this is a difficult problem that we don't yet fully understand!
