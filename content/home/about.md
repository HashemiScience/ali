# Biography
I am a post-doctoral fellow at the Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Health Sciences. My current research is focussed on understanding how basic visual and cognitive processes are affected in healthy and non-healthy older adults, relative to healthy younger adults. I am well versed in programming psychophysical experiments (MATLAB, PsychToolbox), collecting EEG (EGI, BioSemi) and pupillometry (Eyelink), and visualizing and analyzing data (R).

<<<<<<< HEAD
I completed my PhD in the Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab (Allison Sekuler and Patrick Bennett) at McMaster University. My thesis research focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of face perception, and then using these principles to develop a novel stimulus class to study the generalizability of perceptual learning. Throughout my PhD studies, I was lucky to collaborate with plenty of researchers to study 1) population-level EEG dynamics, 2) the effect of perceptual degradation on memory, the effects of ageing on 2 3) figure-ground perception and 4) contour integration, and 5) the continuously probing perceptual rivalry.

THroughout my academic career, I have mentored/supervised dozens of udergradaute thesis or independent project students. I have also twice taught the Inferential Statistics course for Level III Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour students at McMaster University. In my second term as instructor, I introduced R-based labs/tutorials to which stuents were very receptive to. I always attemptt o incoporate best-practices in data visualization and analysis, and continue to develop student resources with this in mind.
=======
I am a scientist with interests in perceptual learning, face perception, attention, and memory. I use psychophysics, electroencephalography (EEG), and pupillometry to collect data. I am proficient in MATLAB (PsychToolbox, EEGLAB) for data collection and processing, and in R/RStudio for data analysis and visualization.

My PhD in the Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at McMaster University was focussed on the neural mechanisms of face perception and perceptual learning. The thesis in its entirety can be accessed here, and in these published papers and conference posters.

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences. My current focus is on investigating the population-level dynamics of adult EEG throughout the lifespan using a massive, novel dataset collected using the Muse. I am also working to dissociate age-related perceptual and cognitive deficits in healthy and clinical populations of older adults.
